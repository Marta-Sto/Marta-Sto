ðŸ‘‹ Hi!


Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscience research master graduate interested in brain dynamics, including neural adaptation and brain-signal variability. I'm also interested in consciousness, both theories of consciousness as well as differences in brain activity (incl. entropy) between conscious states such as wakefulness and sleep. I'm an impassioned advocate of mental health and sustainability. I want to apply my research questions to better understand psychiatric disorders and ageing, and develop better mental health or geriatric interventions.

Iâ€™ve just completed an internship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development where I researched brain-signal variability. In my research I compared measures of neural variability across time, frequency, and information-theoretic domains to standard markers of neural activity in resting-state MEG data from the Human Connectome Project.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments!
