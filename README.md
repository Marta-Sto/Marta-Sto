- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marta Stojanovic!
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscience research master student interested in brain dynamics, including adaptation and brain-signal variability,
- and more broadly, consciousness, with different conscious states and differences between sleep and wakefulness. I'm also an impassioned 
- advocate of mental health, including the importance of mental health research, and sustainability. I want to apply all my research questions
- to psychiatric disorders and to better understand ageing.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing an internship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development where I'm researching brain-signal variability.
- In my research I compare measures of neural variability in time, frequency, and information-theoretic domains to standard markers of 
- neural activity in resting-state MEG and fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project.
