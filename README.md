ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marta Stojanovic!


ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscience research master student interested in brain dynamics, including neural adaptation and brain-signal variability. More broadly, I'm also interested in consciousness, both theories of consciousness as well as differences in brain activity (incl. entropy) between conscious states such as wakefulness and sleep. I'm also an impassioned advocate of mental health and sustainability. I want to apply my research questions to better understand psychiatric disorders and ageing, and develop better mental health or geriatric interventions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing an internship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development where I'm researching brain-signal variability. In my research I compare measures of neural variability across time, frequency, and information-theoretic domains to standard markers of neural activity in resting-state MEG and fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project.
