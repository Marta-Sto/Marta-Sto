- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marta Stojanovic!
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscience research master student interested in brain dynamics, including adaptation and brain-signal variability.
- More broadly, I'm interested in consciousness, both in terms of theories of consciousness and differences in brain activity between 
- conscious states such as sleep and wakefulness. I'm also an impassioned advocate of mental health, including the importance of mental health research, and sustainability. I want to apply all my research questions to psychiatric disorders and to better understand ageing.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing an internship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development where I'm researching brain-signal variability.
- In my research I compare measures of neural variability in time, frequency, and information-theoretic domains to standard markers of 
- neural activity in resting-state MEG and fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project.
